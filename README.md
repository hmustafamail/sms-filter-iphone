Simple SMS Filter for iPhone

Do you have an iPhone? Do you get lots of spam via SMS? Did you look at the filter options that Apple provides, and say, "why does Apple allow me to filter iMessages from senders who aren't in my Contacts, but not SMS? That's stupid." Do you find yourself installing app after app, and being surprised that none of them seem to work after a week? Are you suspicious that the developers are secretly reading your texts?

Well, do I have a thing for you. This is a repository for an iOS app that filters all SMS from senders not in your Contacts list into a dedicated Junk tab. No keywords, no content filters, no machine learning, nothing. Just the blunt filtering functionality that Apple offers for iMessages, but for SMS.

I'm not paying $99 per year to distribute functionality that Apple should have implemented themselves, so if you want it, find a Mac, put XCode on it, import this project, connect your device, and run the app it on your device.
